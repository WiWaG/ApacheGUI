Website
----------------
The ApacheGUI website is located here [http://apachegui.net](http://apachegui.net). Questions and comments can be sent directly to apachegui.net@gmail.com.

Packages
----------------
ApacheGUI Packages are hosted on sourceforge. They can be accessed from the following link [https://sourceforge.net/projects/apachegui/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/apachegui/)


Development Environment
---------------
ApacheGUI is a Maven enabled web project. The project is portable and can be imported to any Java IDE as a Maven project.  

#### Linux / Mac OSX runtime environment
The IX based runtime environment that is used for development is located under *environments/IX/ApacheGUI*.

#### Windows runtime environment
The Windows based runtime environment that is used for development is located under *environments/Windows64/ApacheGUI*

Project Dependancies
---------------
ApacheGUI is dependant on the following project(s). It is not required to download these projects however a large amount of source code uses classes and methods in these projects. The code from these projects are included as Maven dependencies.

- ApacheConfParser ([https://github.com/jrossi227/ApacheConfParser](https://github.com/jrossi227/ApacheConfParser)). This library is used to parse the Apache Server configuration.
- ApacheGUIJdbc ([https://github.com/jrossi227/ApacheGUIJdbc](https://github.com/jrossi227/ApacheGUIJdbc)). This library is used to communicate with the internal SQLite database that ApacheGUI uses.

Building ApacheGUI
----------------
Although Windows is fully supported, it is recommended to use a Linux or Mac OSX distribution when developing ApacheGUI. This is because Apache and Tomcat run more efficiently on IX based distributions.

#### Build Dependancies

- Node js v0.10.25+
- Maven 3+
- Java 1.6+

#### Linux / Mac OSX build steps
1. Navigate to the root directory in the source project (Where pom.xml is located).
2. Open pom.xml and set the *environment* property to IX. The *apachegui.home* property uses the environment property to determine the location of ApacheGUI.
3. Run the Maven builds below.

###### Maven options
- ```mvn clean package -P prod``` minifies required javascript and builds a new war under the *target* directory. 
- ```mvn clean package -P dev``` copies required javascript without minification and builds a new war under the *target* directory. This task is meant to speed up war builds for development. 
- ```mvn clean install -P prod``` minifies required javascript and builds a new war under the *target* directory. The war is then moved from the *target* directory to *[apachegui.home]/tomcat/webapps*. This will re-deploy the application.
- ```mvn clean install -P dev``` copies required javascript without minification and builds a new war under the *target* directory. The war is then moved from the *target* directory to *[apachegui.home]/tomcat/webapps*. This will re-deploy the application. This task is meant to speed up war builds for development. 
- ```mvn antrun:run -P package``` stops ApacheGUI and builds a new .tar.gz archive. The .tar.gz archive is put into the *package.dir* directory that is specified in the pom.xml properties.

#### Windows build steps
1. Navigate to the root directory in the source project (Where pom.xml is located).
2. Open pom.xml and set the *environment* property in pom.xml to Windows64. The *apachegui.home* property uses the environment property to determine the location of ApacheGUI.
3. Run the Maven builds below.

###### Maven options
- ```mvn clean package -P prod``` minifies required javascript and builds a new war under the *target* directory. 
- ```mvn clean package -P dev``` copies required javascript without minification and builds a new war under the *target* directory. This task is meant to speed up war builds for development. 
- ```mvn clean install -P prod``` minifies required javascript and builds a new war under the *target* directory. The task then stops ApacheGUI, moves the war from the *target* directory to *[apachegui.home]/tomcat/webapps* and starts ApacheGUI. This will re-deploy the application.
- ```mvn clean install -P dev``` copies required javascript without minification and builds a new war under the *target* directory. The task then stops ApacheGUI, moves the war from the *target* directory to *[apachegui.home]/tomcat/webapps* and starts ApacheGUI. This will re-deploy the application. This task is meant to speed up war builds for development. 
- ```mvn antrun:run -P package``` stops ApacheGUI and builds a new .zip archive. The .zip archive is put into the *package.dir* directory that is specified in the pom.xml properties.

Running ApacheGUI
-----------------
You must first build ApacheGUI in order to successfuly launch the application.

#### Linux / Mac OSX
1. Navigate to *environments/IX/ApacheGUI/bin*
2. Launch run.sh

#### Windows
1. Navigate to *environments/Windows64/ApacheGUI/bin*
2. Launch run.bat

Stopping ApacheGUI
-----------------
You must first build ApacheGUI in order to successfuly stop the application.

#### Linux / Mac OSX
1. Navigate to *environments/IX/ApacheGUI/bin*
2. Launch stop.sh

#### Windows
1. Navigate to *environments/Windows64/ApacheGUI/bin*
2. Launch stop.bat
